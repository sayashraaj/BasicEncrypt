This is a basic caesar cipher program written in c++, 
but with a very basic randomised key generation function built into the program
The key is randomly generated between two values specified in the code
The key is appended to the encrypted message for the decryption software (in progress) to give the original message
as the output, hence allowing users to store, send or use the encrypted message as and when they like.
The key is generated with reference to the system time, and uses <time.h> C++ library for the feature

Decryption program in progress
